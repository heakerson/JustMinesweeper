- Refactor!
    Step 1: Create Services for all for all of the components and remove all logic from the models
        -DONE counter
        -timer
        -smiley
        -stats?
        -cell
        -grid
        -board
    Step 2. Move the logic out of the services and back in to the component state methods
        -counter
        -timer
        -smiley
        -stats?
        -cell
        -grid
        -board
    Step 3. Delete all the services

    - I think I need to start moving as much logic as possible to the actual state change methods in 
    - UNCOMMENT OUT THE REGISTRATION OF THE COMPONENTS
- Deploy!
- Get some kind of traffic counter
- Do I want the hollow smiley's instead?
- Fix that you can highlight over the cells when paused and see the contents
- Add social media sharing buttons
- Get the info bar next to the grid to look better
    - Maybe consider adding the counter/smiley/timer components in to a single box container somehow
- Create a better disabled class for the pause button (more visible somehow, maybe gray?)
- Update to stats keeper:
    - add 2 decimal points to best time and maybe the timer?
    - average percentage mines located (correctly)
    - update the stats when the new game button is selected
- Add a best time notification somewhere?
