TODO:
==========================
- Add text-primary to any stats cell that isn't zero
- I need a reset stats button
- Keep stats in local storage instead of having it disappear every time
- Change the smiley on every down click
- Do I want the hollow smiley's instead?
- Fix that you can highlight over the cells when paused and see the contents
- Update to stats keeper:
    - average percentage mines located (correctly)
    - update the stats when the new game button is selected
