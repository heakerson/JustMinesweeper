TODO:
==========================
DO I WANT TO DO THIS? Remove timerService from the stats service and have the timer component call the stats Service update with the time
    I could also just make it a little better

- when the url changes, this triggers (in the board component), the creation of a new BoardModel, which then creates a new GridModel, which then initializes
    the cells. Figure out how to get rid of this

    BUGS:
        - Right now, I'm resetting EVERY time a component is registered in the gameStateManager, which means it's taking a long time when you go to expert
            - this DID solve the issue of the initial counter being wrong until a new game was clicked.
            - find a better way to know when all the components have been registered to call a new game.
            - this is ALSO causing issues in the stats service
        - After the grid has been build, GetAdjacentCells should be called for all cells all at once and then not called again
        - Why the Grid.Pause also UNpause??

    - I think I need to start moving as much logic as possible to the actual state change methods in 
    - UNCOMMENT OUT THE REGISTRATION OF THE COMPONENTS
- Deploy!
- Get some kind of traffic counter
- Do I want the hollow smiley's instead?
- Fix that you can highlight over the cells when paused and see the contents
- Add social media sharing buttons
- Get the info bar next to the grid to look better
    - Maybe consider adding the counter/smiley/timer components in to a single box container somehow
- Create a better disabled class for the pause button (more visible somehow, maybe gray?)
- Update to stats keeper:
    - add 2 decimal points to best time and maybe the timer?
    - average percentage mines located (correctly)
    - update the stats when the new game button is selected
- Add a best time notification somewhere?
