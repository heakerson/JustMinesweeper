TODO:
==========================
- Deploy!
- Get some kind of traffic counter
- Do I want the hollow smiley's instead?
- Fix that you can highlight over the cells when paused and see the contents
- Add social media sharing buttons
- Get the info bar next to the grid to look better
    - Maybe consider adding the counter/smiley/timer components in to a single box container somehow
- Create a better disabled class for the pause button (more visible somehow, maybe gray?)
- Update to stats keeper:
    - add 2 decimal points to best time and maybe the timer?
    - average percentage mines located (correctly)
    - update the stats when the new game button is selected
- Add a best time notification somewhere?
